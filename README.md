## Purpose
4 developers, 4 friends, 4 full-time learners in our first hackaton experience

SD Work gave us this task:
"What could you build that we can offer to our customers to increase their employee engagement?"

## IDEAs
Communication inside both littles and bigs companies is really hard.
Maybe an employee have an amazing idea but his voice is lost...
Maybe the managers are stuck on something...
Maybe the solution is inside your own company, maybe you need to ask Gary from the 2nd floor, or Karen from accountant.

IDEAs purpose is to promote the best, and only the best, ideas from your own employees, and improving their engagement to company's colture!
Your managers will have a win win situation, with nice idea at their disposal and more engaged employees.
