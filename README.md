## Purpose

4 developers, 4 friends, 4 full-time learners in our first hackaton experience

SD Work gave us this task:
"What could you build that we can offer to our customers to increase their employee engagement?"

## IDEAs

Communication inside both little and big companies is really hard.

Maybe an employee has an amazing idea but his voice is lost...

Maybe the managers are stuck on something...

Maybe the solution is inside your own company, maybe you need to ask Gary from the 2nd floor, or Karen from accounting.

IDEAs purpose is to promote the best, and only the best, ideas from your own employees, while improving their engagement and promoting positive company culture!

Your managers will have a win win situation, with nice ideas at their disposal and more engaged employees.
